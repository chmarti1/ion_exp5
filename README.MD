# Experiment 5

Experiment 5 is a spatially resolved measurement of ion density in the oxyfuel preheat flame using a novel spinning wire Langmuir probe.  The repository is currently too large to commit to GitHub, so users interested in the data should download it from Penn State University's Scholarsphere.  Thanks for your interest.
